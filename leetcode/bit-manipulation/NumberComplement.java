//Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
//
//
//
//        Example 1:
//
//        Input: 5
//        Output: 2
//        Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
//
//
//        Example 2:
//
//        Input: 1
//        Output: 0
//        Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
//
//
//        Note:
//
//        The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
//        You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
//        This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
